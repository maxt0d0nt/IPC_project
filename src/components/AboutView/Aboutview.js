            </div>
            <p>IPC maintains a fully equipped, permanently staffed UL 508A and 698A control panel shop at its Duncan, OK headquarters. IPC panels are carefully designed according to your exact requirements.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>We fabricate panels of all sizes and complexities, from isolation panels for fuel or other applications, to whole plant system controllers. IPCâ€™s consistently high standards of quality are applied in everything we do, from the careful routing and labelling of wires to the precision laser-cut doors.</p>
            <br></br>

            <p>IPC panels are fabricated with close engineering input, and with precise attention to detail:</p>
            <br></br>

            <ul>
              <li>Interior space is always allowed for future expansion of capabilities</li>

              <li>Wires are bundled and clearly labeled for ready identification</li>

              <li>All control panel components are national brand name, UL listed and top-of-the-line</li>

              <li>Panels are thoroughly power tested point-to-point in our shop prior to shipment</li>

              <li>Turnkey project panels are fully tested against plant and project-specific hardware, HMI screens and PAC/PLC code prior to shipment</li>

              <li>All panels include complete drawings and documentation</li>
            </ul>
